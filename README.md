# Getting Started
The first thing I'd say is that starting out with [**blue team**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_team_(computer_security)) (defending networks) will give you breathing room and time to learn pen testing/[**red team**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_team), as blue team IMO is a bit easier (requires less deep and specific knowledge) and you really should have experience there anyways before you do red team so you know how to avoid being detected. You should also learn programming ASAP, as it helps with every aspect of security ([**Python**](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) is a good beginner language, but you will want to learn [**C**](https://www.learn-c.org/) as well at some point.)  Another piece of the puzzle to consider is learning [**system**](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/1563088-home-lab-ideas-to-be-a-network-systems-administrator) and [**network**](https://www.cybrary.it/network-administration/) administration, as you will want to understand computers in every aspect to be more successful in detecting or performing cyber attacks.

# Blue Team
For blue team you should get a **mirrored switch** for home ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=mirror+port+switch&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Amirror+port+switch)), and use [**Security Onion**](https://securityonion.net/) to practice with [**Suricata**](https://suricata-ids.org/) and [**Wireshark**](https://www.wireshark.org/). Basically you want to set up a mirror port to send packets to your Security Onion PC ([Amazon Link](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=zotac+zbox&rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Azotac+zbox)), which you log in to and try your best to understand what is happening on your home network.  Go to [Test My IDS](http://testmyids.com/) to see what an alert looks like, and make sure your IDS is working properly.  The new Security Onion ([Github Link](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/securityonion-elastic)) uses the [**ELK stack**](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack), which I've used professionally, so just learning that is a really good start.  If you don't understand Cisco, go out and get your [**CCNA**](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/training-events/training-certifications/certifications/associate/ccna-routing-switching.html), as this will also help with both red and blue team.

Also, you can learn a lot by looking at [**Malware Traffic Analysis**](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net), and writing up what you think is going on in the [**packet captures**](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/training-exercises.html). If you use [**Packet Total**](https://packettotal.com), you can load up the captures they give you and analyze what's going on in them fairly easily. You could also download the capture files and replay them in **Security Onion**, so you will see a more real-world example of what attacks look like in "real-time".  Use my [**IPINT Tool**](https://github.com/exaybachay-ak/IPINT) to get more context regarding the IP addresses you are seeing.

Finally, although my experience in this arena is limited, you should also consider learning some techniques related to Incident Response and Forensic Analysis.  Your first stop should be installing and learning the [**Volatility Framework**](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility), which is used almost universally in memory forensics.  Next, you will want to familiarize yourself with the curated [**Awesome Incident Response**](https://github.com/meirwah/awesome-incident-response) repo in Github.  Finally, the [**PoshSec Framework**](https://github.com/PoshSec/PoshSecFramework) is a good platform to learn, which can help you set up a system to be ready for IR, and it's free so you can do this from your home lab.  Try installing it and attacking your systems that have it installed, and then tweaking the settings until you can detect attacks in this way (maybe send PoshSec logs to Security Onion or your preferred SIEM for analysis.)  Once you have the hang of running and using PoshSec, go through the code itself to understand how it is constructed and consider writing modules for it.

# Red Team
One of the most important things you can do here, if you haven't already, is switch your primary OS from Windows to [**Linux**](https://www.archlinux.org/).  Doing this will help you in a number of ways, but the most noticeable way is that almost every security distribution and hacking challenge uses Linux as its foundation.  When you do hacking challenges, you will be expected to know [**bash**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) very well, and you should be familiar with the filesystem on a \*nix computer.  Note that you should make an effort to move entirely to Linux as your primary OS, so you can familiarize yourself with the initial struggles and obstacles that come along with the transition away from Windows.  The more time you spend at the bash prompt, the more prepared you will be for penetration testing. 

With that out of the way - if you want to get a head start on red team, I'd recommend checking out the [**Github "awesome" repos**](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Agithub.com+"awesome-"&oq=site%3Agithub.com+"awesome-"), which include "[**awesome-pentest**](https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-pentest)", "[**awesome-ctf**](https://github.com/apsdehal/awesome-ctf)", and "[**awesome-security**](https://github.com/sbilly/awesome-security)". There is a huge amount of good info there - my advice is just to not get overwhelmed, and try to set goals for yourself to stay on track - e.g. "I will review one entry from Awesome Pentest this week", "I will get my S+ in 6 months", "I'll do 15 minutes of programming every day/weekend", "I will finish one CTF challenge per month", etc...  Protip - make your goals very simple and repetative, so you can spark your interest, which will quickly grow strong.  Everyone can afford to spend 5 minutes programming per day.. what you will find though, is that after 5 minutes you will want to continue programming once you find interesting challenges to tackle.

[**Root-me.org**](https://root-me.org) is also awesome for learning hacking in general, where they give you concrete challenges, and the resources are attached to the challenges to make it easier to learn and understand.  Look at **awesome-ctf** for more platforms, but in my experience the best beginner ones are: 
* [PicoCTF](https://picoctf.com/)
* [Root-me](https://www.root-me.org/?lang=eng)
* [Exploit Exercises](https://exploit-exercises.com/)
* [Over the Wire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/)
* [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/)

# Getting Hired
## Certifications
My advice here is to get both certifications **and** practical experience as soon as possible, because it will prepare you for first passing the initial resume screening/keyword search, and also make sure you are ready for some technical and practical questions during your interview.  The above advice should set you on a path to get practical skills and experience, while the below list charts a rough order of which certs you may want in order to obtain employment in the IT Security field.

* [S+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/security)
* [CSA+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/cybersecurity-analyst)
* [L+](https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/linux)
* [RHCSA](https://www.redhat.com/en/services/certification/rhcsa)
* [GISF](https://www.giac.org/certification/information-security-fundamentals-gisf)
* [GSEC](https://www.giac.org/certification/security-essentials-gsec)
* [GMON](https://www.giac.org/certification/continuous-monitoring-certification-gmon)
* [GCIA](https://www.giac.org/certification/certified-intrusion-analyst-gcia)
* [CISSP](https://www.isc2.org/Certifications/CISSP)
* [CISA](http://www.isaca.org/Certification/CISA-Certified-Information-Systems-Auditor/How-to-Become-Certified/Pages/default.aspx)
* [OSCP](https://www.offensive-security.com/information-security-certifications/oscp-offensive-security-certified-professional/)

You can get great training for these certs online, at places like [NICCS](https://niccs.us-cert.gov/training/search), [Tom's IT Pro](http://www.tomsitpro.com/tags/security+certification/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com) and [Cybrary](https://www.cybrary.it/).

## Social Networking
While certs and experience are very valuable, and can go a long ways towards landing you a job, the third thing that will give you the best chances at obtaining a desirable and well-paying job in the industry is **networking**.  No, I don't mean you should grab a firewall and some switches and start subnetting away (although that's never a bad idea).. I mean that you need to start talking with people in the IT Security industry.  

Go out and join your local hackerspace/makerspace, and see what people there are excited about.  Get on IRC and meet people that are working on [**Metasploit**](https://metasploit.help.rapid7.com/docs/joining-the-metasploit-irc-channel), [**PowerShell Empire**](https://bloodhoundhq.slack.com/), [**Security Onion**](https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=securityonion), [**Root-Me**](https://www.root-me.org/en/Community/IRC-channel/), and other security projects.  Join some local/regional Cyber Security User Groups, and attend conferences like [**DEFCON**](https://www.defcon.org/), [**DerbyCon**](https://www.derbycon.com/), and [**Wild West Hackin' Fest**](https://www.wildwesthackinfest.com/).  I can speak from experience, that all of the skills in the world can't beat good real-world connections.

## Interview Skills
Finally, once you get a job interview lined up you have to do a great job making a good first impression.  My advice has always been that, even if you lack specific skills or knowledge, you should be prepared to be so confident and personable, that the interviewer(s) don't notice or don't care.  In my opinion, there is no excuse for having a bad interview, you just have to treat it like another skill that you are out to master.  Here are [**some tips**](https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/interviewing/job-interview-tips-how-to-make-a-great-impression) about preparing for, and making a great impression during your interview.

# Overcoming obstacles
This last part is **crucial**:  if you encounter barriers, or hit a wall with challenges, go onto **IRC** or **reddit** and ask the professionals.  The infosec community is a very strong one, with one important caveat.  DO NOT ASK TO BE HAND-FED.  You must go in and ask questions so you don't get stuck and lose motivation, but do not go and say "hey everyone, I want to hack my wifi so where do I begin", or "I can't get this loop to work, can you tell me what's wrong with it?"  You should demonstrate that you have done basic Google searches first, and put in some effort before you start to ask for help, otherwise people will most likely be hesitant to spend their (most likely valuable) time doing your work for you.
